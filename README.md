# class-script-mover
Simple Scripts to move files

The default structure should look something like this in your folder...

class-repo - will hold a clone of the github repo
class-scripts - will hold a clone of this repo
daily* - will hold today's folder
lesson-plans - will hold the fullstack curriculum

# Future Plans

1. Add sub functions in the script for changing the class repo

1. Change this to use a web frontend for easy manipulation later
